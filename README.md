# Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction-
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

# SUMMARY : 
In this notebook, We will be using Linear Regression and Rnadom Forest Regressor and evaluate the best model by its R-Square value. 

## Linear Regression 
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.
A linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of y when x = 0).

By fitting a line through the sample training data points, we get a linear regression model and this line can be used to predict the output with different datapoints.
